# Hello, Earthlings. 👋

This is my blog. It is a small signal flare from San Diego, meant to say: I am here, and I am still curious.

## What you'll find here

I write about the things that keep me up, or at least keep me awake:

- **Software engineering** — building systems, fixing the leaky ones
- **Machine learning** — useful spells, and the occasional misfire
- **Career** — the awkward parts of growing in public
- **Life in San Diego** — sunshine, salt air, and the occasional taco

## Why bother?

Writing is the cheapest form of time travel. It lets future‑me remember, and maybe helps someone else avoid the same potholes. So it goes.

## Say hello

If anything here makes you nod, laugh, or squint, [reach out](/index.html#contact). I like good conversations.
