# Hello World! 👋

Welcome to my corner of the internet! I'm Rishabh, a software engineer based in San Diego.

## What to expect

I'll be writing about:

- **Software Engineering** – Lessons learned building systems at scale
- **Machine Learning** – Practical applications and interesting research
- **Career** – Navigating tech, interviewing, and growth
- **Life in San Diego** – Because sometimes you need a break from code

## Why blog?

I've always found that writing helps me think more clearly. Plus, if something I learned the hard way can help someone else, that's a win.

## Let's connect

If you want to chat about anything I write, feel free to [reach out](/index.html#contact)!
