### Introduction 

I graduated from Texas Tech University in May 2022 with a Bachelor's in Computer Science and moved to Austin, TX! 🤠. 

While in school I closely worked with [Codepath](https://www.codepath.org/) as a Tech Fellow to provide high quality iOS development curriculum to the students at Texas Tech. I'm interested in applications of deep learning to practical problems. I like to dabble on the more tradTech as well, which I might talk about in another place when I feel like it.


I'm a Software Engineer at Oracle (Oracle Cloud Infrastructure - OCI) working on the [Speech AI capabilities of the Oracle Cloud](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/speech/using/speech.htm). 


This introduction isn't all comprehensive or my <b>resume</b>, which you can ask me for if interested. Email me at [tewaririshabh1@gmail.com](mailto:tewaririshabh1@gmail.com)
