### Introduction 

I graduated from Texas Tech University in May 2022 with a Bachelor's in Computer Science and moved to Austin, TX! ðŸ¤ . 

While in school I closely worked with [Codepath](https://www.codepath.org/) as a Tech Fellow to provide high quality iOS development curriculum to the students at Texas Tech. I'm interested in applications of deep learning to practical problems. I like to dabble on the more tradTech as well, which I might talk about in another place when I feel like it.


I'm a Software Engineer at Oracle (Oracle Cloud Infrastructure - OCI) working on the [Speech AI capabilities of the Oracle Cloud](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/speech/using/speech.htm). 


This introduction isn't all comprehensive or my <b>resume</b>, which you can ask me for if interested. Email me at [tewaririshabh1@gmail.com](mailto:tewaririshabh1@gmail.com)


##### Things I've been up to that aren't work 
* 
  + tpot (ifykyk)
  <!-- : The tpot community in Austin has it's own unique flavor to the more technical (e/acc, founder, etc.) oriented communities of San Fransisco and leans typically non technical in my experience. -->
  + Boxing / Muay Thai
   <!-- - I'm a beginner in both, and have only been doing it for a couple of months. Getting punched in the face absolutely sucks, but I believe it was neccessary for me. -->
  + Cooking (I'm a good cook, believe me) & Eating
  + irl Standup comedy (mostly watching these days)
  + Thinking
