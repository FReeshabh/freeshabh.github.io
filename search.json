I‚Äôm interested in applications of deep learning to practical problems. I like to dabble on the more tradTech as well, which I might talk about in another place when I feel like it.\nI‚Äôm a Software Engineer at Oracle (Oracle Cloud Infrastructure - OCI) working on the Speech AI capabilities of the Oracle Cloud.\nThis introduction isn‚Äôt all comprehensive or my resume, which you can ask me for if interested. Email me at tewaririshabh1@gmail.com\n\nThings I‚Äôve been up to that aren‚Äôt work\n\n\ntpot (ifykyk) \nBoxing / Muay Thai \nCooking (I‚Äôm a good cook, believe me) & Eating\nirl Standup comedy (mostly watching these days)\nThinking"

    "text": "Some blog issues are more for me rather than the general public, and it‚Äôs unlikely that I am going to make these posts public, however in order to preserve my own sanity for the future, And hopefully someone else (Hello if you found this! Go eat a cookie). I have decided to write some general notes on the usage of Panda3D here.\n\n\n\nReason I am writing this, is I don‚Äôt believe the instructions available on GitHub are ample for people to get started with their own development built of Panda3D. Of course you can keep pinging rdb, Moguri, and CFSWorks to high hell, like I did last year, trying to get this started.\nI am currently on Arch Linux, I used to be on MacOS, which I remember made things sligtly trickier for a while. If I remember what my thoughts were on that, I will eventually put them here (Hint: Thirdparty stuff). In the meantime.\n\nStep 1: Clone the repository:\nThis step has been left as an excercise to the reader\nStep 2: Build stuff Make sure you have the dependencies ready to go. I usually don‚Äôt go with a wheel or an installer route python makepanda/makepanda.py --everything --no-egl --no-gles --no-gles2 --no-opencv --threads=4\nMake sure your computer is powerful enough to have 4 threads, a good rule is to 2 x number_of_cores to get how many threads you need. You can always go with no threads, keeps your PC cooler, but takes longer to compile everything.\nSet enviroment variables This is the reason why I don‚Äôt care about having an installer or a wheel. Just let your computer know where to find the built stuff\nexport PATH=*path/to*/panda3d/built/bin:$PATH  export PYTHONPATH=*path/to*/panda3d/built:$PYTHONPATH  export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=*path/to*/panda3d/built/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH (Make sure there are no spaces in setting the enviroment variable (sh rule!)\n\nAloha, Ciao, Alvida, whatever you speak\nbye"

However if anyone else happens to come across this. Aces! You get a unicorn, just not from me. Aside from the weak attempt at humor/humour gained from watching too much British telly over this quarantine break, here‚Äôs some rambling. (Keep reading find the best OS, distro, GUI to work in the most efficient way!)\nTo follow through this incoherent jumble of thoughts I expect the following from you: 1. A little familiarity with Linux (if you correct me by saying GNU/Linux, or GNU+Linux, I am legally obligated to burn a GNU plushie, so let‚Äôs not harm little Gnu‚Äôs shall we?)\n\nAbility to search for things on the internet. (much more of a skill than people usually give it credit for)\nSome time spent that will not benefit in you gaining any tech knowledge\n\nI also recognize a lot of my thoughts will come to look inspired (or reflected) from and by Luke Smith. I do not share his political beliefs, however it would be unfair to say he wasn‚Äôt the reason I started using Linux full-time, and teaching me about it. That said today I will echo his words ‚ÄúLinux distributions are a social construct‚Äù, but go a little further down the rabbit hole and talk about why most things people usually take sides on (i.e.¬†Window Managers, text editors, etc.) also are.\n\n\nSo here‚Äôs what usually ends up making a functional Linux box (for the end-user, not a server): 1. Hardware : hah, yes 2. The kernel: This is what ‚ÄúLinux‚Äù is, the kernel. It interacts the hardware and the software, pretty important don‚Äôt ya think? 3. The userspace: This is where YOU come in, and interact with the system.\nSo what makes separates a distribution from another? 1. The Graphical Stuff: This is what births most of these spinoff distributions: Kubuntu, Lubuntu, Mate, which are all Ubuntu, with a different default GUI from regular Ubuntu. I‚Äôd be ignorant to say that‚Äôs all they change, but I am not looking to make friends here, so why not throw in Elementary, Mint and others in too (I know they worked hard on Pantheon, now please let me live).\n\nThe Runit system: This I respect more. These people knew they wanted a change, and went doing this in the worst way possible. Of course more props to OG distros more than spinoff ones. OG is Void, Gentoo, GUIX(my apologies), and spinoffs are Artix, Devuan, etc. If you think I am gonna comment on SystemD (I know it‚Äôs not capitalized like that), you‚Äôre out of your mind.\nPACKAGE MANAGER: Biggest one: How to install packages? pacman (represent), portage, apt, xbps, etc. Congrats you made yourself unique! Now go and do the same thing which the others do. If you can‚Äôt, doctors recommend LFS.\nFSF Reasons: This website is hosted by GitHub (at the time of writing), so why are you here. Shoutouts to Parabola, Trisquel, PureOS, Hyperbola (no shoutouts to this one), etc.\nSomething Special: This is where something unique comes in, like Nix and guix, and you can‚Äôt figure out how to install pip packages. (For noobies: Nix is more usable, GUIX is for:___ )\n\n\n\n\nTo anger even more of this already segmented Linux community, something I might be a part of (verdict still out). Newbies end up forgetting they are using a COMPUTER to do actual work. I have been in this position, and well have accepted a single thing that (mostly) works out for me (hint using someone else‚Äôs dots).\nYou are not to gain anything more from making your system look prettier, and more and more efficient.

    "text": "Problem Abstract\n\n\nPanda3D currently provides various backends for audio functionality that include OpenAL and FMOD. Both of these backends provide excellent support for audio however, they FMOD limits the holder‚Äôs permission to distribute FMOD based on the development budget, and OpenAL has a proprietary license (Panda3D uses an LGPL version). These licensing terms don‚Äôt fit Panda3D‚Äôs licensing spirit, which being based on a Modified BSD license is very permissive.\n\n\nSoLoud is a free (as in speech AND beer) audio engine for games released under the very permissive ZLib/LibPNG license. Zlib/LibPNG and Modified BSD Licenses, are very similar licenses, allowing much wider usage of this audio engine in Panda3D games. Aside from licensing, SoLoud has a native C++ API making it perfect to integrate into Panda3D, while still providing support for other interfaces such C, Python Ruby, etc. SoLoud has also been integrated into RPGMaker and GameMaker, which gives it a certain credibility for its usage in games.\n\n\nSoLoud supports commonly used formats such as 8, 16, 32 bit wavs, floating point wavs, ogg, mp3. Although it‚Äôs mentioned that there might exist certain cases that SoLoud is not equipped to handle yet. SoLoud also has limited SSE Optimization, so there are still cases where using an alternative backend such as FMOD might be useful."

    "text": "Benefits to the community\n\n\nThis project adds an alternative audio backend for usage for Panda3D. This implemented audio backend would be a more permissive option than the current popular options of FMOD and OpenAL, since SoLoud uses a ZLib license. Aside from licensing, SoLoud has a relatively easy to use interface, and it has proven itself worthy for gaming, since other gaming engines/frameworks (such as RPGMaker, and GameMaker use it)."

FFmpeg uses a restrictive LGPL license which limits the freedom of the users and contributors, and the large dependency makes it quite hard to maintain. The proposed solution to the problem is to implement an alternative native video loader for Panda3D to give the user the ability to switch their video loader.\n\n\nMy proposed solution is to implement WebM‚Äôs libvpx as an option into Panda3D to load files, implement threading support for libvpx as done for FFmpeg already, and provide tests and documentation for the implemented video loader."

I went twice, bombed horribly, no timing, somewhat plagiarized jokes (on the advice of my roommate). And basically it was bad, but I didn‚Äôt feel like it was a bad experience, since going up on the stage, in some ways or the other, gives me a confidence boost. And then I didn‚Äôt do it anything until the next academic year.\nThe push for actually doing standup comedy instead of just fantasizing about doing it came from a TV show and a movie, being Marvelous Mrs.¬†Maisel, and the Big Sick (I don‚Äôt know why this pushed me to do comedy, but it did). Also with the massive boredom I was facing in my life. Then I found out about a local scene happening from the local subreddit and started going to them. First Mic was a bomb, but the second one went alright.\n\n\n\n\nYou‚Äôll never be for everyone\n\n\nAnd that‚Äôs okay! Your goal is to make people laugh, not make all the people laugh.
